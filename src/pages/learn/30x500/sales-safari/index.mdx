Everything in business is marketing

You need to understand your market. You need to read their mind

Marketing is used to:

to _attract_ people
to _persuade_ people
to _serve_ people

## **Rules for Picking an Audience:**

Your audience is your peers, people who wish they were your peers (newbs), and people that would hire you and your peers (clients).

- 1. They need to be online.
- 2. Must buy on value.
- 3. You must already belong to your audience.

## Sales Safari

Sales Safari is the process of learning what naturally attracts and motivates people 'out in the wild.' It uncovers what pains they are going through and builds context for how the community individually and collectively deals with that pain.

The Sales Safari technique includes three ingredients for you to start speaking your audiences language: **Pain**, **Jargon**, **Recommendations.**

Sales Safari is not an optimized workflow because it's more about how your brain processes the data you collect than collecting the most amount of data out there. You want to feel the pain of your audience so you can truly know where they are coming from.

Feeling your audiences pain sets you up for success when you develop solutions for their pain

## Ebomb

Sales Safari is the raw material that will inform you where to go next, not necessarily build a product. The recommendation is to start stacking the bricks (Ebombs) before trying to build a business.

## Definitions

- **Sales Safari** - The term is used because you want to go to where people are acting naturally, not a zoo where interaction is forced (already a customer, asking 'what's your problem')
- **Watering hole** - Places that your audience naturally congregates in your community to talk amongst themselves. The zoo version is doing cold-calling and outbound marketing.
- **Pain** - Pain is composed of the facts; outcome vs. situation. The key is to identify the actions and behaviors that trigger the feelings around it.
- **Jargon** - This is the Insider lingo. This is important when creating e-bombs. Look for specialty words, terms of art from the community.
- **Recommendations** - This is advice that's given in the community. References are resources ‚ÄúBreadcrumbs‚Äù
- **Ebomb** - One output for Sales Safari. An Ebomb addresses the pain of someone in your audience by showing you understand where they are coming from and offering solutions that work. The "I get it" version of marketing.
